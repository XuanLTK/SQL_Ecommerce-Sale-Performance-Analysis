## üìå Background & Overview  

### Objective:
Query eCommerce dataset to answer business inquiries.
Used Google BigQuery platform to conduct queries on Google Analytics public dataset.

### Outcome: 
Provided insights on user behavior to enhance business strategies.

### üë§ Who is this project for?
‚úîÔ∏è Data analysts & business analysts  
‚úîÔ∏è Decision-makers & stakeholders  

###  ‚ùìBusiness Questions:  
1. Calculate total visits, pageview, transactions for Jan, Feb, and March 2017 order by month
2. Bounce rate per traffic source in July 2017
3. Revenue by traffic source by week, by month in June 2017
4. Average number of pageviews by purchaser type (purchasers vs non-purchasers) in June, and July 2017.
5. Average number of transactions per user that purchased in July 2017
6. Average amount of money spent per session. Only include purchaser data in July 2017
7. Other products purchased by customers who purchased the product "YouTube Men's Vintage Henley" in July 2017. The output should show the product name and the quantity ordered.
8. Calculate cohort map from product view to "addtocart" to "purchase" in Jan, Feb, and March 2017 
  ‚Äî for example, 100% product view then 40% add_to_cart and 10% purchase.
  Add_to_cart_rate = number product add to cart/number product view. 
  Purchase_rate = number product purchase/number product view.
  The output should be calculated in product level.
